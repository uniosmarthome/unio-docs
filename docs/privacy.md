Your privacy is critically important to us.
We believe that a Smart Home system should be fully secured and that the owner of the system should have full ownership over it's data.

At UNIO Smart Home, we have a few fundamental principles:

- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it to run our services.
- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, UNIO Smart Home collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. UNIO Smart Home uses the Google Analytics service for this. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our website. From time to time, UNIO Smart Home may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

UNIO Smart Home also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. UNIO Smart Home only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to UNIO Smart Home website choose to interact with it in ways that require UNIO Smart Home to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that UNIO Smart Home gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, those who engage in transactions with UNIO Smart Home are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, UNIO Smart Home collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with UNIO Smart Home. UNIO Smart Home does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

UNIO Smart Home discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on UNIO Smart Home’s behalf or to provide services available at UNIO Smart Home’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using UNIO Smart Home’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. UNIO Smart Home will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, UNIO Smart Home discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when UNIO Smart Home believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of UNIO Smart Home, third parties or the public at large.
